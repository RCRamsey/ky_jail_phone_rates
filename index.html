                            The above map explores the cost of a 15 minute phone call from 32 different jails across
                            Kentucky (prison policy 2018).
                            An average from all those mapped was determined and the jail’s respective values in relation
                            to
                            this average (above or
                            below) is presented upon click. These inflated costs are a blatant roadblock Kentucky’s
                            jails
                            construct leading to
                            re-incarceration of vulnerable populations.

                            Isolation or solitary confinement is a common practice among incarceration facilities and is
                            employed as a form of
                            punishment, but what is oftentimes overlooked is the isolation of the incarcerated from
                            communications to the outside
                            world. Incarceration facilities operate with technology out of the 80’s with walkman,
                            typewriters, paper/pencil and time
                            constrained telephones [john j lennon interview]. Only recently have a few facilities
                            incorporated technology
                            (e-tablets) permitting limited email (for a fee). If the stated end goal of incarceration
                            facilities is the successful
                            permanent reintegration of their members back into society as responsible citizens, how are
                            they
                            expected to accomplish
                            this if they’re isolated from the community they are to return to?

                            Fifteen years ago, WMMT (radio station 88.7 operating out of Whitesburg, KY), began
                            broadcasting
                            recorded toll free
                            call-in phone messages from friends and family members of the incarcerated during their
                            Calls
                            from Home program (see
                            video on right). The station continues to this day to offer this imperative service reaching
                            many prisons, regional
                            jails and detention centers (see map right).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            WMMT took it upon themselves to incorporate the new program to address the needs of their
                            audience members. It wasn’t
                            until 2014 when the FCC placed caps on the exorbitant rates of fees for phone calls within
                            prisons leading to a cap of
                            $0.21 per minute with a max $3.00 per 15 minute phone call (see line graph). Unfortunately,
                            jails did not benefit from
                            this and their rates remain on average 3 times higher.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Kentucky the pre-trial population in jails has more than doubled since 1978 (see line
                            graph)
                            and on any given day
                            incarcerates approximately 13,000 residents (see pie graph). Jails are providing a literal
                            “captive market” and negate
                            the “innocent until proven guilty” statement as ¾ of those in jails (approximately 9,750 of
                            the
                            aforementioned
                            population) are not convicted or even sentenced but rather are held pretrial if bail can not
                            be
                            met. The high price of
                            phone communication drives up the cost for counsel and makes it harder to contact others to
                            make
                            bail or build a
                            defense. The prevention of making bail, increases the risk for the pre-trial population of
                            losing their job, housing,
                            and/or custody of children the longer their wait. Phone calls are imperative.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are many reasons a legacy of phone rates and fees are high across jails. Jails are
                            smaller
                            entities in comparison
                            with prisons, have a less flexible budget and are less eager to think long term as they are
                            ran
                            by elected officials
                            looking toward the next election. Additionally the population impacted find it difficult to
                            sustain pressure on the jail
                            administrators as most people are released in hours or days. Compounding the issue, is the
                            corporate consolidation of
                            phone contract providers to 2 primary providers (and 14 smaller entities) since 1984 (Prison
                            Policy Initiative) making
                            it virtually impossible to negotiate better rates.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            High phone rates (what you pay per minute) leads to overlooking another exacerbating
                            problem,
                            hidden fees. When
                            receiving a phone call from jail a person has a few options to answer. Initially they could
                            connect the call for a
                            special fee and pay the associated rates and taxes OR they could set up an account
                            (surprisingly
                            less expensive in the
                            long run) to avoid the special fee for connection. HOWEVER, hidden fees include: a fee to
                            open
                            an account to pay for
                            accumulated phone costs, a fee for having an account, a fee to listen to a voicemail, a fee
                            to
                            load money into an
                            account, a fee to close the account, a fee to get a refund, a fee to receive a paper bill
                            and
                            more. On top of this,
                            persons living in poverty are the most likely to be incarcerated or have incarcerated loved
                            ones
                            and less likely to have
                            bank accounts so they tend to use money transfers. Even the money transfer companies get in
                            on
                            the business by charging
                            another fee to transfer money into an account (in Kentucky $6.99-%11.99). When the <a
                                href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/60000975214.pdf">FCC</a> was
                            investigating the fees for
                            prisons, they stated the fees “can increase the cost...” of communication “by as much as
                            40%.”
                        </p>

                        <p>Increasing the likelihood of relying on phone communications is the urban vs rural status of
                            a
                            county (see map). The more rural a county, the less access family’s have to public
                            transportation (if no vehicle is owned). Rural counties are also known for a longer commute
                            to
                            facilities requiring the visitor, if employed, to take off work, losing critical income in
                            comparison to paying phone rates/fees. Additionally, some counties relocate their
                            incarcerated
                            populations to external counties as they do not house their own jail, increasing the
                            distance
                            between the incarcerated and their families. As of May 2021 the percentage of a county’s
                            population being incarcerated (see map) ranged from 0-7% demonstrating the percent of a
                            county
                            bein impacted by these rates and fees.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There’s no better time than on the heels of the FCC’s capped rates than now to begin a
                            conversation with Kentucky’s elected officials about negotiating better phone rates and
                            limiting
                            abusive fees on the vulnerable populations the incarceration facilities are attempting to
                            serve.
                            The topics of the conversation proposed should include how jails should refuse
                            kickbacks/commission on phone rates, and strike harder bargains with their providers. The
                            only
                            way to obtain the aforementioned end goal of successful permanent reintegration of members
                            into
                            society as responsible citizens is to halt the isolation of these citizens to their
                            communities.

                <!-- 2nd Body text for page -->
                <p>Increasing the likelihood of relying on phone communications is the urban vs rural status of a
                    county (see map). The more rural a county, the less access family’s have to public
                    transportation (if no vehicle is owned). Rural counties are also known for a longer commute to
                    facilities requiring the visitor, if employed, to take off work, losing critical income in
                    comparison to paying phone rates/fees. Additionally, some counties relocate their incarcerated
                    populations to external counties as they do not house their own jail, increasing the distance
                    between the incarcerated and their families. As of May 2021 the percentage of a county’s
                    population being incarcerated (see map) ranged from 0-7% demonstrating the percent of a county
                    bein impacted by these rates and fees.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There’s no better time than on the heels of the FCC’s capped rates than now to begin a
                    conversation with Kentucky’s elected officials about negotiating better phone rates and limiting
                    abusive fees on the vulnerable populations the incarceration facilities are attempting to serve.
                    The topics of the conversation proposed should include how jails should refuse
                    kickbacks/commission on phone rates, and strike harder bargains with their providers. The only
                    way to obtain the aforementioned end goal of successful permanent reintegration of members into
                    society as responsible citizens is to halt the isolation of these citizens to their communities.
